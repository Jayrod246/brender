# Argonaut Blazing Render (BRender)

This is the source code to version 1.1.2 of the BRender engine by Argonaut Software/Argonaut Games, from approximately 1995/09/07, but modified to be cross-platform. Meant to (eventually) be used with 3DMMForever.

This is intended as a basic release to let others build on, and more info on how to build and use this code will be added later.

See also [the release of a 1997 version of the BRender engine](https://github.com/foone/BRender-1997) and [version v1.3.2](https://github.com/foone/BRender-v1.3.2).

## Source of this code

This code was used (with minor modifications) to build the game Privateer 2: The Darkening by Electronic Arts. No Privater 2 code is included in this release.

[crocguy0688s modification of BRender](https://github.com/crocguy0688/CrocDE-BRender) provided a good reference for how some of the `memloops.asm` routines should be translated over to C.

## Approval to open source this software

Approval to open source this was given in an email from Jez San, former CEO of Argonaut.
