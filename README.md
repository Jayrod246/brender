# Argonaut Blazing Render (BRender)

This is the source code to version 1.1.2 of the BRender engine by Argonaut Software/Argonaut Games, from approximately 1995/09/07, upgraded to work with CMake.

The CMake support isn't exactly complete, however. Some of the automation done in the old build system (such as running `h2inc` on certain header files) remain unimplemented. the `TOOLS` and `DOSIO` backend for BRender have been completely removed (for now). Despite all of that, it is *completely buildable*.

This is intended as a basic release to let others build on, and more info on how to build and use this code will be added later.

See also [the release of a 1997 version of the BRender engine](https://github.com/foone/BRender-1997) and [version v1.3.2](https://github.com/foone/BRender-v1.3.2).

## Source of this code

## Approval to open source this software

Approval to open source this was given in an email from Jez San, former CEO of Argonaut.
